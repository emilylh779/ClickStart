<p> General Appearance - A graceful lithe, muscular dog, wth no signs of weakness or coarseness. Whole head pear or wedge shaped and expression in repose mild and gentle.
Characteristics - Spirited and game, full of confidence.  An intelligent companion with strong sporting instincts.
Temperament - Good natured, having an affectionate nature, dignified, not shy or nervous.  Mild in repose but full of courage when roused.
Head and Skull - Skull narrow, but deep and rounded, covered with profuse silk top-knot which should be nearly white. Jaw long and tapering. There must be no “stop”, the line from occiput to nose end straight and unbroken. Well filled up beneath eye.  Close fitting lips, without flews. Nostrils large and well-defined.
Ears - Moderate sized, filbert shaped, set on low and hanging flat to the cheek. Thin and velvety in texture,
covered with short fine hair with fringe of whitish silk hair on tip.
Neck - Long and tapering, deep base with no tendency to throatiness. Springs well up from shoulders and head
carried high.
Mouth - Teeth large and strong. Scissor bite, ie upper teeth closely overlapping the lower teeth and set square to the jaws.
Body - Muscular and markedly flexible. Chest deep and fairly broad.  Flat ribbed, deep through brisket which reaches
to elbow. Back has natural arch over the loin, creating a definite tuck-up of underline. Body slightly greater in
length than height.
Forequarters - Forelegs straight, wider apart at chest than at feet. Pasterns long and sloping without weakness.  
Shoulders flat and sloping.
Hind Quarters - Muscular and moderate length, arched loin with curved topline immediately over loins.  
Hind legs have appearance of being longer than forelegs. Hocks strong and well let down, turning neither in nor out.
Feet - Long hare feet with thick and well closed up pads.  Pads sound and free from cracks or horny excresences.
Tail - Moderate length, thick at root tapering to a point and gracefully curved. Set on low, never carried over back.
Gait/Movement - Capable of galloping at high speed and has appearance of being able to do so.  Action very 
distinctive rather mincing, light and springy in slower paces and slight roll when in full stride.
Coat - Very distinctive.  Thick and linty, standing well out from skin but not wiry.  A distinct tendency to twist particularly on head and face.
Colour - Blue, liver or sandy with or without tan.  Darker pigment to be encouraged. Blues and blue-and-tans must 
have black noses, livers and sandies must have brown noses.
Size - Height about 16 inches at withers. This allows for a slight variation below in the case of a bitch and above 
in the case of a dog. Weight between 18 and 23 pounds.
Faults - Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault, and the seriousness with which the 
fault should be regarded should be in direct proportion to the degree. </p>
